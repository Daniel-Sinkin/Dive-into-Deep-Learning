This course was recommended by the d2l team, so I'll check it out, it's good to refresh stats stuff, been a long time since I've learned it. Unfortunately the book uses R instead of python, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem. I won't learn R just for the book though, most things probably translate pretty easily to python.

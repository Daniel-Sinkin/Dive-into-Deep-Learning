# Introduction
The two main iideas of this chapter are the following
1. The **law of large numbers**, which states that the sample average converges in probability to the expectation, i.e. that it is close to the mean.
2. The **central limit theorem** which states that $$\sqrt{n}(\overline{X}_n - \mu)$$ converges in distribution to a Normal distribution, i.e. that the sample average is approximately a normal distribution

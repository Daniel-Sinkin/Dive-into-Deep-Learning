Define what a $\mathcal{G}$-measureable set is and what does that mean for the information about a system that we have. How do we use this in finance?
&*
Let $X$ be a random variable defined on a nonempty sample space $\Omega$. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$. If every set in $\sigma(X)$ is also in $\mathcal{G}$, we say that $X$ is $\mathcal{G}$-measureable.
$X$ is $\mathcal{G}$-measureable if and only if the information contained in $\mathcal{G}$ are sufficient to determine the value of $X$.
A portfolio position $\Delta(t)$ taken at time $t$ must be $\mathcal{F}(t)$-measureable (i.e., must depend only on information available to the investor at time $t$).

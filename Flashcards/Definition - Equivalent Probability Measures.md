Define what it means for two probability measures to be quivalent.
Give an example.
&*
Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty set and $\mathcal{F}$ a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$. Two probability measures $P$ on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ are said to be equivalent if they agree which sets in $\mathcal{F}$ have probability zero.
An example would be [[Flashcards/Definition - Risk Neutral Probability Measure]].

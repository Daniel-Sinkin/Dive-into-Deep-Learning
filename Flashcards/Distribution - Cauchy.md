What is the Cauchy distribution? What is its density? Explain why this distribution is interesting.
&
The Cauchy distribution is just $t_1$, then the PDF is
$$
f_1(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}(1 + x^2)^{-1}
$$
It looks like a normal distribution with "thicker" tails. This causes it to not have neither mean nor variance. As such it gives a nice example of what can go wrong with the commonly used theorems for random variables.   Has neither mean nor variance (recall $t_\nu$ as mean if $\nu > 1$ and variance if $\nu > 2$).

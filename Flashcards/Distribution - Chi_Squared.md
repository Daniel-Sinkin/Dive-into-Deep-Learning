Define the $\chi^2$ distribution, what is its PDF. What is the relationship between the $\chi^2$ distribution and the normal distribution?
&
$$
X \sim \chi_p^2
$$
has PDF
$$
f(x) = \frac{x^{p/2 - 1}}{\Gamma(p / 2)2^{p/2}} e^{- x  / 2},
$$
where $x > 0$. If $Z_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ iid then
$$
\sum_{i = 1}^p Z_i^2 \sim \chi_p^2.

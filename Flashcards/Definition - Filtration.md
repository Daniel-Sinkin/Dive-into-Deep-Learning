Define what a Filtration is. 
&*
Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty set. Let $T$ be a fixed positive number, and assume that for each $0 \leq T$ there is a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}(t)$. Assume further that if $s \leq t$, then every set in $\mathcal{F}(s)$ is also in $\mathcal{F}(t)$. Then we call the collection of $\sigma$-algebras $\mathcal{F}(t), 0 \leq t \leq T$, a filtration.

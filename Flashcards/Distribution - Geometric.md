Define the Geometric Distribution, what is its mean, what is its variance.
What does it model?
&*
Let $p \in (0, 1)$. $X \sim \operatorname{Geom}(p)$ if
$
P(X = k) = p(1 - p)^{k - 1}
$
for $k \geq 1$.
mean = $1 / p$, variance = $\frac{1-p}{p^2}$.
Getting heads exactly on the kth flip and all flips before were tails.
mean = $1 / p$, variance = $(1 - p) / p^2$.

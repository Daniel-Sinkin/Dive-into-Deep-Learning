Here are my notes on the two books by Steven Shreve of the same name. I might split it up into two folders later, after all he wrote two books.

Furthemore I might skip the first book if it's not technical enough, although it's probably good to get a more intuitive understanding of this stuff, and the first book isn't that long anyway.

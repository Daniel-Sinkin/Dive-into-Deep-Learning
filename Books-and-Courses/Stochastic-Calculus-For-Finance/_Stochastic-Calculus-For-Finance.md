Here are my notes on the two books by Steven Shreve of the same name. I might split it up into two folders later, after all he wrote two books.

Furthemore I might skip the first book if it's not technical enough, although it's probably good to get a more intuitive understanding of this stuff, and the first book isn't that long anyway.

Yeah, after looking over the first book, I'll just use the second one and reference the first one as needed, the author mentioned that the second book is self-contained.
